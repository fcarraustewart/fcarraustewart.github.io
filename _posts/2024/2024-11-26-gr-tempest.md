For our bachelor’s thesis in electrical engineering, we contributed to the SDR (Software Defined Radio) and RF hardware research project on GitHub, specifically improving C++ modules and DSP paths, originally developed by Federico Larroca.
https://github.com/git-artes/gr-tempest

Our primary goals were to enhance performance and add robust functionality:

- We designed and characterized an RF analog front-end circuit for optimal signal conditioning and antenna performance, addressing significant signal degradation in HDMI and VGA emissions with proper filtering and amplification.
- We optimized the DSP algorithm to use FFT-based input signal processing, significantly reducing computation load for time synchronization and image tracking, potentially lowering hardware costs.
- Our improvements enabled 1080p resolution eavesdropping, a substantial upgrade from the original 180p–360p limitations, and supported both HDMI and VGA signals.
