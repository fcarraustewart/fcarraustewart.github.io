## A bit of introduction
Hi, this is Felipe. I am an electronics engineer currently based in Paris, France. I've been born and raised in Montevideo, Uruguay, into a familiy with a mix of spanish and scottish descendants who were dedicated to wine-making, biochemistry, science and medicine. I thought adding electronics and music to this established mix would make it an interestingly spicy addition, therefore, I adventured myself into this world, with a little help from my friends, of course.

Throughout my career I crossed path with many great teachers that I am fondly thankful for. Topics ranged from programming down to radio-frequency emissions or signals, wanted or unwanted, being expelled into the air by the code I was writing. Very motivating stuff.

## A bit of history of my career arc and its different branches

### SDRs RF Hacky stuff

Oscilloscopes Logic Analyzers and Frequency Spectrum Analyzers were added to the arsenal, in order to understand what the code was doing and what was going on inside the cables of these devices. I chose a mix of SDR devices, Linux and C++ as my final project and dissertation to attain the Electrical Engineer BAC+5 diploma in December 2021 at Montevideo, Uruguay. I happened to be curious and stunned by the project that my tutor had been developing, and I developed an attraction to the hacky athmosphere of SDRs, and the community behind it.

### Music Audio and DSP stuff
I've developed my right-side brain, ears and hands throughout all my life, I surrounded myself with great people that helped me get my feet back to earth when cables machines and programming got in the way of real life, these were my musician friends, my circle of companions, connected without words, without reason, constructing pieces of music with a lot less planning a lot more of intuition. Very useful processes to complement the more hard-wired, reasoning based, job and studies I carried on in the professional career.

### Embedded Systems BLE deep diving into building hardware and architecturing software stuff
I've found my go-to tool in microcontroller based solution that include some wireless communication to some host or base to complete the human interaction or database cloud stuff. Basically, IoT.

### PLCs, high voltage and moving bigger-than-humans stuff
I spent a lot of time fighting a project of 27 motors connected to VFDs, connected to PLCs, architecturing a state-machine, and making the boot-up inside a factory that made cookies.
